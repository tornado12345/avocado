This is a set of ansible playbooks and supporting code to test the
deployment of Avocado in a number of different environments, and
installed via a number of different methods.  These are intended to be
used as regular playbooks, so roughly the following steps should be
followed:

 1) Install ansible.  If you need help, refer to
    https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide

 2) Adjust your inventory, that is, the hosts that will be used on the
    playbook execution.  The simplest way is to edit the inventory
    file this directory.

 3) (OPTIONAL) adjust your configuration on vars.yml

 4) Run a playbook with: ansible-playbook <PLAYBOOK_FILE_NAME>

The following Ansible playbooks are available here:

 - pip-git.yml: deployment of Avocado and Avocado-VT using pip, from a
   GIT repository, on a Python virtual environment.  Tested on EL7,
   Fedora 28 and Fedora 29.

 - rpm-copr.yml: deployment of Avocado and Avocado-VT using RPM, from
   a Copr repository that follows the latest Avocado and Avocado-VT
   from the GitHub repository master branch. Tested on EL7, Fedora 28
   and Fedora 29.
