# This example shows how to define test as well as params together in one
# file. To execute it simply install avocado_varianter_yaml_to_mux plugin
# and run this as if it was a test (avocado run $this_file)
#
# test_reference - specifies the test reference to be loaded with the default
#     (file) loader.
