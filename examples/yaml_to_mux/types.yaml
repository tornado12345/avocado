    path:
        containing:

                this will produce `self.params.get("value")` clashes as
                Avocado can't determine which of those values do you need.
                You have to use `self.params.get("value", path="*/by_type/*")`
                or `self.params.get("value", path="*/some/path/*")` to
                distinguish which `value` you have in mind.
